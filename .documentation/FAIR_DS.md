## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

GAIA-X emphasizes decentralized identity management using federated services. You can use protocols like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, which JHipster already supports.
• Keycloak: Use Keycloak for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect-based authentication. Keycloak provides features like identity brokering and user federation, which align well with GAIA-X’s decentralized identity concept.
• In JHipster, use the --auth oauth2 option when generating your project.
• Set up federated identity providers, e.g., integrate with external identity providers through OpenID Connect or SAML, ensuring that user identities remain under control and privacy is maintained.

## Data Sovereignty with Cloud Federation

Implement cloud services that adhere to GAIA-X standards for decentralized and federated data storage.
• Federated Data Services: Store patient data in a cloud provider that supports the GAIA-X framework. Choose services that support S3-compatible storage or use Apache Hadoop-based distributed file systems with federation capabilities (e.g., Ceph).
• Data Localization: Enforce data residency rules to comply with local regulations. GAIA-X emphasizes controlling where your data is stored geographically, so ensure data is stored within the required jurisdiction (e.g., within the EU).

## Transparency and Auditability

Enable logging, monitoring, and auditing features to ensure compliance with GAIA-X transparency requirements.
• Use Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and auditing APIs.
• Ensure GDPR compliance by implementing data access logs and enabling data erasure and correction capabilities in line with GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure).
